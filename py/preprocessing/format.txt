gtfs: route is a group of trips, trips can be associated to shapes and stop times

so our basic thing is a table of trips, we also have a table of routes and a table of shapes.

route: metadata shared among trips
  id, name = route long name, vehicle type ("train"/"bus"/"boat"), url, color, text_color

trip: a single bus ride (multiple trips follow the same route)
  route_id, days of week it runs (mon to sun), headsign, shape id
  list of, for each stop along trip:
    stop id, arrival time/departure time, shape points from this stop to next stop, cumulative distances.

stop: a single bus stop, just has latlon

shape: list of points, each point has coords and dist along

we also need timezone of agency and a little more agency data

----------------------------------------
vehicle:
  which route it runs on (from below)
  real color (also autogenerate hue?)
  list of points, each point has:
    if stop: arrive/depart time, name???
    all have location
  frequency
  type of vehicle (bus vs train)
  info about route? (number/name, text color, etc?)

route: dictionary? route id from 
  polyline
  coloring system: specify hue
    if too many parallel routes, condense into one hue
  maybe time range active?
  figure out what to do when >>5 lines follow same path
